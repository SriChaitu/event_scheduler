# EVENT SCHEDULER

## Overview

This Flutter project implements a "New Event" screen that allows users to add a new event by entering the event details using a TextField and submitting it with an "ADD" button. The screen uses Material Design components such as AppBar, TextField, ElevatedButton, and follows a purple color theme.

## Features

The key features of this project are:

- New Event Form: The screen contains a form that includes a TextField for users to enter the event details. The entered text is captured using a TextEditingController and stored as the new event data.

- AppBar: The screen has an AppBar with a purple color background and a title "New Event" to provide a consistent and intuitive user interface.

- Styling: The screen uses color themes to provide an appealing visual experience, with a purple color scheme for the background, TextField, and ElevatedButton components.
